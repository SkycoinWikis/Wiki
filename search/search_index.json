Skycoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency. Skycoin was written from scratch and designed over four years to realize the ideal of Bitcoin and represents the apex of cryptocurrency design. Skycoin is not designed to add features to Bitcoin, but rather improves Bitcoin by increasing simplicity, security and stripping out everything non-essential. Some people have hyped the Skycoin Project as leading into \"Bitcoin 3.0\". The coin itself is not \"Bitcoin 3.0\", but is rather \"Bitcoin 1.0\". Bitcoin is a prototype crypto-coin. Skycoin was designed to be what Bitcoin would look like if it were built from scratch, to remedy the rough edges in the Bitcoin design. no duplicate coin-base outputs enforced checks for hash collisions simple deterministic wallets no transaction malleability no signature malleability removal of the scripting language CoinJoin and normal transactions are indistinguishable elimination of edge-cases that prevent independent node implementations <=10 second transaction times elimination of the need for mining to achieve blockchain consensus Consensus Medium Article: A comprehensive guide to the consensus and skycoin obelisk Medium Aricle Audio Version: Telegram Message Link CoinHours (SCH) What are coin hours? Coin hours are a parallel currency within the Skycoin blockchain, alongside skycoins. Coin hours are used to pay transaction fees in the network. In the future, coin hours will be used in other applications beyond the Skycoin cryptocurrency, such as Skywire . Coin hours are generated based upon the age of coins in a transaction output. What is a transaction output? A Skycoin transaction consumes one or more outputs and creates one or more outputs. Each output has an owner address, an amount of coins and an amount of hours. When you send coins to someone, you destroy some outputs that are owned by addresses in your wallet and you create some new outputs. How are coin hours generated? For every 1 coin in an output, 1 coin hour is created after 1 hour elapses. Time is measured between the blockchain's current head block timestamp and the timestamp of the block in which the output was created. Internally, the value is calculated as \"coin seconds\", then rounded down to the nearest whole coin hour. This implies that: A 0.1 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 10 hours (36000 seconds) A 1 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 1 hour (3600 seconds) A 10 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 6 minutes (360 seconds) Generated coin hours are calculated at the time that the output is spent, and are added to the output's initial coin hours. The elapsed time is the timestamp of the previous block, not a computer's clock time. How are coin hours used for transaction fees? A transaction must destroy a percent of its total input coin hours in order to be valid. It can optionally destroy more, to prioritize the transaction in a congested network. Currently, the percent that must be destroyed is 10%. The value is always rounded up (i.e., if there are 5 input coin hours, 3 must be destroyed). A transaction must destroy at least 1 coin hour. Transactions are prioritized for inclusion in a block by their coin hour burn fee per byte. Larger transactions (measured in bytes) require a higher amount of coin hours burned to achieve a higher priority. Wallets There are three options to hold Skycoin and generate SCH while holding.

Skywire is the next evolutionary step in the Internet's development and use.

Our goal is to provide everyone with access to fast, secure, private and reliable Internet. It is time to leave ISPs as a relic of the past. Customers routinely have their browsing data tracked, stored and sold by ISPs, and at the same time experience unreliable coverage and poor customer service. Instead of relying on corporate-owned networks, the Skywire mesh network runs on widespread user-owned nodes which come together to provide the infrastructure for the network, allowing communities to power their internet access. Skywire is an incentivized meshnet and darknet which runs on a dedicated hardware backbone of official Skyminers containing proprietary technologies and DIY Skyminers made of consumer-grade hardware which can be bought off the shelf from around the globe at widely affordable rates. Skywire acts as a truly secure VPN and SOCKS5 proxy which can also connect to the legacy Internet. It circumvents the corrupt ISPs, telecoms, and government services which spy upon our internet traffic to sell our data to each other or worse. The meshnet of Skyminers allows users Skywire to financially profit by transmitting one another's encrypted traffic data in exchange for $SCH Coin Hours.

Just follow the next steps to setup Ubuntu 18 Linux Subsystem and configure the hypervisor. Note The following commands can be pasted directly in Powershell using the right click on the mouse. 1. Enable Linux Subsystem Press WIN + X and then A to open Powershell as administrator Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux Save your work on the pc and confirm with Y and press Enter when asked to reboot. 2.
