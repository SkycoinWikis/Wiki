Checking the Firmware The Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user. However, it is vital to check that your Skywallet is not compromised before using it. Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet First, connect the Skywallet to your USB port. Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display The display on your Skywallet shows one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Skywallet.

Thus if you get any message apart from the welcome message, proceed to disconnect the device and contact support immediately. Scenario 2 A previously used Skywallet may have a firmware initialized, and if it has, then it might mean that it has been manipulated. Such a Skywallet will display the following message on its display screen: Needs Seed! Along with the Skycoin Logo. If you get a \"Needs Seed!\" message on your first use, it means that your Skywallet is not a new one and has a firmware already initialized.

If you do not find a resolution for your issue, make sure you contact the support team via - store.skycoin.com/pages/support . You can also send an email at support@skycoin.com . 1. Lost/Stolen Skywallet If your Skywallet is lost or stolen, the recommended solution is to get a new one as soon as possible. Once you got the new Skywallet, restore the coins using the Seed of your old Skywallet. Even though not a recommended method, as an immediate solution, you can also create a new Desktop Wallet to restore the lost Skywallet. This method is not recommended and should only be used if you cannot get a new Skywallet, as entering the Seed of your Skywallet into any electronic device could potentially compromise the security of the Seed of your Skywallet and hence putting your coins at risk. Note If you are opting for this solution, note that this is a temporary solution, and it is always recommended that you transfer your coins (not restore the backup of the old Skywallet) to a new Skywallet as soon as you obtain one. Also, it is vital that you configure your new Skywallet as a new one with a new Seed and not restore the backup of your old Skywallet if the Seed has already been entered in your Desktop Wallet. 2. Lost the PIN code of Your Skywallet If you have forgotten or lost the PIN code to your Skywallet then the only way to retrieve your funds is using your Seed . You can use the Seed of your Skywallet to Wipe the Device and then restore the device using the same Seed. The wiped device will not have a PIN code set, and it is recommended that you immediately set a PIN code that is easy to remember but at the same time not easy to guess. You can visit the following chapter to know more about setting a PIN and the security recommendations for your Skywallet - Optimize account security . 3. Too Many Transactions Issue Bug When you try to send coins to a Wallet and if the particular transaction has too many inputs or outputs, then an error message will be displayed upon pressing the \"Preview\" button or the \"Send\" button. To still transfer your funds, you can split up your transaction into multiple transactions and then send the coins.

Upon configuring your Skywallet, it will be listed in the Wallet list. The list can be viewed when you open your Desktop Wallet. To personalize your Skywallet, connect your Skywallet via USB to your computer and then open the Desktop Wallet. Once the Desktop Wallet is opened, click on the Hardware Wallet button in the Desktop Wallet window. Once you click on the \"Hardware Wallet\" button, the following window will appear: When you use the Skywallet for the first time, you will find two warnings associated with Creating a Backup and Setting a Pin , displayed in the Desktop Wallet window. Both of these warnings are to be dealt with seriously, or it may compromise the security of your Skywallet. To complete these two tasks, you can use the options in the Hardware Wallet window. Following are the options available in this window: Create a backup The Seed of your Skywallet is a key component. A Seed is the only way to access the coins stored in your Skywallet. Once the initialization is complete, it is essential to backup this Seed and store it in a secure location. To backup the Seed of your Skywallet, click on the button \"Create a backup\" . Once you click the \"Create a backup\" button, a warning message will be displayed. After accepting this warning message, the Skywallet will start to display the words in your Seed one by one. You need to note down each of these words and store it in a secure location. You would have obtained a Seed card along with your Skywallet, we recommend you to use this Seed card to note down your Seed. Note - Make sure that it is retrievable because if anything happens to your device, it will be impossible to retrieve your coins without the Seed. After completing the display of the words in the Seed, the screen displays all the words in the Seed again , so that you can verify your entries. Note - After completing the Backup process, you cannot repeat the same. Hence it is essential to note the Seed down during this process. Once you have completed the backup process, the \"Create a backup\" button will be replaced by \"Confirm Seed\" button. To ensure optimal security, please make sure to go through this section of the user manual - Optimize account security Create PIN code Creating a PIN code for your Skywallet enhances its security, as only a person with the PIN can access the device. To create a PIN for your Skywallet for the first time, click on the button - Create PIN code Once you click on the button \"Create PIN code\" the following window will appear on the Desktop Wallet: Simultaneously a number Matrix will be displayed on your Skywallet display screen. To set the PIN, you have to use both the matrix as well as the Desktop Wallet window. Each position of the number in the matrix corresponds to its position in the keypad shown by the Desktop Wallet window. Alternatively, you can utilize the number keypad on your computer for entering the PIN. However, if you are using the number pad then note that the position of the number in the matrix is what decides which number you are entering. Note While setting up your PIN you have to enter it twice. After setting up your PIN, you can manage the PIN by changing or deleting the same. Change the PIN code Once you have created a PIN code, you can make modifications to your PIN code using the Hardware Wallet window. You can use the Change PIN Code option to change your current PIN code to a new one. Upon clicking the \"Change PIN Code\" button, the Hardware Wallet window will show you a keypad similar to the one you used to create the PIN code. You can enter the PIN code by utilizing the number matrix displayed by the Skywallet in the same way you used it for creating the PIN code. To change the PIN code, you have to enter the current PIN code first and then the new PIN code twice. Delete the PIN code Ideally, a Skywallet should always have a PIN code, and it is a recommended precaution to improve the security of your Skywallet. However, you can choose to delete the PIN code of your Skywallet using the Hardware Wallet window. To delete the PIN code of your Skywallet, you can click on the Delete PIN Code button. After accepting the confirmation message, you will be asked to enter the PIN code of your Skywallet. Once entered and comfirmed, the PIN code of your Skywallet will be deleted.

Following are the options available in this window: Create a backup The Seed of your Skywallet is a key component. A Seed is the only way to access the coins stored in your Skywallet. Once the initialization is complete, it is essential to backup this Seed and store it in a secure location. To backup the Seed of your Skywallet, click on the button \"Create a backup\" . Once you click the \"Create a backup\" button, a warning message will be displayed. After accepting this warning message, the Skywallet will start to display the words in your Seed one by one. You need to note down each of these words and store it in a secure location. You would have obtained a Seed card along with your Skywallet, we recommend you to use this Seed card to note down your Seed. Note - Make sure that it is retrievable because if anything happens to your device, it will be impossible to retrieve your coins without the Seed. After completing the display of the words in the Seed, the screen displays all the words in the Seed again , so that you can verify your entries. Note - After completing the Backup process, you cannot repeat the same. Hence it is essential to note the Seed down during this process.

One of two things is necessary for a third party to access your Skywallet, which is either your Skywallet along with your PIN code of the Skywallet or the Seed of your Skywallet. So when it comes to security optimizations, these are the two vital components to be considered. PIN Code Your PIN code is a four-digit combination, and a brand new Skywallet which you receive via shipment will not have a PIN code. Hence, it is essential first to set a PIN code right after you receive your Skywallet. If you want to know more about how to set the PIN code and personalize your Skywallet, please visit the user manual Personalization of your Skywallet . Although the PIN code is only a combination of four digits, it is improbable for an attacker to guess a secure PIN. Because after each failed attempt, one has to wait for a specific time before attempting the next combination and with each failed attempt the waiting time increases exponentially thus making it highly unlikely for an attacker/hacker to obtain access to your Skywallet. However, such a security precaution is ineffective if you create an insecure PIN. Examples of an insecure PIN include, but are not limited to, important dates, or sequences (like 1234) or repeating digits(1111). Hence a secure PIN code is something easy to remember and at the same time not easy to guess for a third party. Seed A Seed of the Skywallet is even more critical than a PIN code, as a hacker/malware without access to your Skywallet physically, can remotely access or steal your fund just using the Seed. As the Seed is not created by you and is generated on the device, you need not worry about the strength of the Seed as such. However, it is imperative to keep the backup of the Seed in a safe and accessible place, as it is the only way to access your funds if anything happens to your Skywallet. Following are some recommendations to backup and store your Seed safely: Do not Store the Seed in an electronic device. Because saving a Seed in an electronic device effectively nullifies the security it ensures, as the electronic device can potentially be hacked by an attacker, thereby giving access to your Seed. Hence it is recommended to store the Seed in a paper or a notebook which can then be stored in a safe place that is inaccessible to any unauthorized person at the same time not prone to any accidents. The only instance when the Seed is entered into a computer is when you are restoring the backup of your Skywallet , in that case, the Skywallet and Desktop Wallet process the Seed in a secure way which ensures that a third party will not gain access to your Seed. The process is explained in detail in the section Restore Backup . Create multiple copies of the Seed and store it in separate locations. Make sure to inform of at least one location of the Seed to your immediate family member(s) as a precaution in case of an emergency. You can also go for splitting up the Seed in parts to store it in different locations or to have a cipher code for the words in the Seed. However, both these methods have a risk factor and are not recommended approaches unless you are ready to take the risk.","title":"Optimizing the security"},{"location":"hardware/skywallet/manual-7-optimizing-the-security/#optimizing-the-security-of-your-skywallet","text":"Even though a Skywallet provides greater security when compared to a Desktop Wallet, it is essential to follow these security optimizations to get maximum security benefit from your Skywallet.

Skycoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency. Skycoin was written from scratch and designed over four years to realize the ideal of Bitcoin and represents the apex of cryptocurrency design. Skycoin is not designed to add features to Bitcoin, but rather improves Bitcoin by increasing simplicity, security and stripping out everything non-essential. Some people have hyped the Skycoin Project as leading into \"Bitcoin 3.0\". The coin itself is not \"Bitcoin 3.0\", but is rather \"Bitcoin 1.0\". Bitcoin is a prototype crypto-coin. Skycoin was designed to be what Bitcoin would look like if it were built from scratch, to remedy the rough edges in the Bitcoin design. no duplicate coin-base outputs enforced checks for hash collisions simple deterministic wallets no transaction malleability no signature malleability removal of the scripting language CoinJoin and normal transactions are indistinguishable elimination of edge-cases that prevent independent node implementations <=10 second transaction times elimination of the need for mining to achieve blockchain consensus Consensus Medium Article: A comprehensive guide to the consensus and skycoin obelisk Medium Aricle Audio Version: Telegram Message Link CoinHours (SCH) What are coin hours? Coin hours are a parallel currency within the Skycoin blockchain, alongside skycoins. Coin hours are used to pay transaction fees in the network. In the future, coin hours will be used in other applications beyond the Skycoin cryptocurrency, such as Skywire . Coin hours are generated based upon the age of coins in a transaction output. What is a transaction output? A Skycoin transaction consumes one or more outputs and creates one or more outputs. Each output has an owner address, an amount of coins and an amount of hours. When you send coins to someone, you destroy some outputs that are owned by addresses in your wallet and you create some new outputs. How are coin hours generated? For every 1 coin in an output, 1 coin hour is created after 1 hour elapses. Time is measured between the blockchain's current head block timestamp and the timestamp of the block in which the output was created. Internally, the value is calculated as \"coin seconds\", then rounded down to the nearest whole coin hour. This implies that: A 0.1 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 10 hours (36000 seconds) A 1 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 1 hour (3600 seconds) A 10 skycoin output generates 1 coin hour every 6 minutes (360 seconds) Generated coin hours are calculated at the time that the output is spent, and are added to the output's initial coin hours. The elapsed time is the timestamp of the previous block, not a computer's clock time. How are coin hours used for transaction fees? A transaction must destroy a percent of its total input coin hours in order to be valid. It can optionally destroy more, to prioritize the transaction in a congested network. Currently, the percent that must be destroyed is 10%. The value is always rounded up (i.e., if there are 5 input coin hours, 3 must be destroyed). A transaction must destroy at least 1 coin hour. Transactions are prioritized for inclusion in a block by their coin hour burn fee per byte. Larger transactions (measured in bytes) require a higher amount of coin hours burned to achieve a higher priority. Wallets There are three options to hold Skycoin and generate SCH while holding.
